# Codex CLI adapter.
#
# The OS layer, the web terminal, tini, and the /etc/agent/config.yaml ETL all
# live in coding-runtime. What is left here is the Codex CLI plus the three
# files that describe it to the base: a manifest, an emitter, and a launcher.
#
# The base is pinned by tag *and* digest. Never :latest, and never a `main`
# build — metadata-action stamps those with the version literal `main`, which no
# `requires.codingRuntime` range can satisfy, so every boot would warn about a
# version mismatch that is not real.
